OpenATLAS uses SQLite and SpatiaLite as offline database backends.
For the connection between frontend and backend ODBC Drivers are used.
They are licenced under various licenses which are included in the /licence/ 
folder of the OpenATLAS installation.

If you use PostgreSQL and PostGIS Servers as a backend, you should have 
downloaded and installed it on your own using a respective license that
came with the software itself. OpenATLAS does not distribute any PostgreSQL
or PostGIS Server Software, though it comes shipped with SQL-scripts for
setting up the OpenATLAS database on an already installed Postgres/PostGIS Server.
These scripts are licensed under the GNU General Public License.

Some icons used in OpenATLAS come from the Open Icon Library. Also their licence
texts are included in the aforementioned folder.

The MS-Access frontend is created within this Microsoft programme. This software
of course is not shipped with OpenATLAS and the user needs a licensed Version of
MS-Access on his or her computer in order to legally use OpenATLAS.

Concept, design and content of the Frontend though is licensed under the GNU General 
Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Some parts of the code in OpenATLAS
were integrated from various other sources. They are of course commented in the
VBA code and the respective copyright note is documented there.
