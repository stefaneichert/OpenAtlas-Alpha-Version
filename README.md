OpenATLAS is a database application for the work with archeological,
historical and spatial data. The developement is currently at an
early stage and carried out by a small team from the University of Vienna.

It uses classes and properties from the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model
of the International Council of Museums to map its data. This international
standard for digital humanities garanties a high compatibility and
sustainability for the information collected in OpenATLAS.

OpenATLAS is powered by Postgresql and PostGIS (or Sqlite and Spatialite
in the file based-offline version) and therefore connectible to every
common GIS program like Qgis or ArcGIS. The project is written in c++,
using the Qt-framework in version 5.1 (status 2013-07-14).
